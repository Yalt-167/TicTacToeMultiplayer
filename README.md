#Tic Tac Toe 
This is a Multiplayer TicTacToe game made with SFML and Winsoc2

The game architecture is a classical Server/Client (tho the server is set to localhost) and therefore is Server Authoritative.
The game also features a chat in case you wanna distract the friend you are playing with and also lets you disconnect and reconnect at any moment.
